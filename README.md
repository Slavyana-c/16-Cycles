Software Engineering Project, Year 2, Semester 2.
Jonathan Alderson, Andy Parkes, Ciaran Brennen, Domantas Dilys, Matthew Cumber, Slavyana Chervenkondeva

This is our group project, consisting of a Flask web application and a QT desktop application for staff members.

===============
To build and run the applications open the terminal and type: 
$ sh make.txt 

This will create a virtual environment and install all required flask modules to run the project.

The website can then be accessed on:
http://127.0.0.1:8111/
